We test a hypothesis of this sort by drawing a random sample from the population in question and calculating an appropriate statistic on its items. If, in doing so, we obtain a value of the statistic that would occur rarely when the hypothesis is true; we would have reason to reject the hypothesis. The choice of the statistical test depends on the research aim, research plan, statistical model, and the variables' measurements procedure, its power and efficiency.</P>"
